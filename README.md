Carbon is a self-updating, lightweight, intelligent mod 
loader for Rust utilizing the latest C# and Harmony for the best 
performance and stability possible. Its robust framework and backward 
compatibility with Oxide plugins make it the ultimate replacement for 
those wanting better functionality and performance from their plugins!

Carbon has all the creature comforts you need to run your 
server, such as a permission system, user system, and so much more. 
Carbon is developed by experienced developers and server owners working 
to take the tedium out of hosting servers and make configuration and 
setup seamless with an integrated GUI in-game to manage everything!
